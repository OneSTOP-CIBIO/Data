Useful datasets for OneSTOP modelling and prioritisation tasks in WP5

**Species_list_vX.xlsx** | A species list intended for species distribution modelling in T5.1. 
Includes a proposal for classifying terrestrial (i.e., to be modelled in T5.1) and strictly aquatic 
species (not to be modelled).

Version changes:

v1 - first commit      

v2 - adds info on the phyllum, species type and one common name       

v3 - corrects some issues with the list     

v4 - This update adds 50 Living Labs species to the main species list. All entries have been checked for accuracy and formatted consistently with existing records.

The following species names were corrected: 
- Lamiastrum galeobdolan subsp. argentatum -> Lamium galeobdolon subsp. argentatum
- Thaumatopoeia processionea -> Thaumetopoea processionea

The following species names were replaced by accepted names in GBIF backbone:

- Brachyponera chinensis (Emery, 1895) -> Pachycondyla chinensis
- Pennisetum setaceum (Forssk.) Chiov. -> Cenchrus setaceus
- Urva auropunctata (Hodgson, 1836) -> Herpestes javanicus
- Orthriophis taeniurus (Cope, 1861) -> Elaphe taeniura
- Euphrosyne xanthiifolia (Nutt.) A.Gray -> Cyclachaena xanthiifolia
